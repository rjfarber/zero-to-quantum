<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>The goal of this site is to explain in a step-by-step manner how to solve research problems using quantum computers (at least first with quantum annealers).
While academic papers' methods sections should do this, these are written for experts within respective subfields.
This tends to enhance the "ivory tower" problem wherein the only way to become an expert in a specific topic
is to be trained by an existing topic. While this is arguably the most time-effective way to become a master,
several problems exist with the typical apprenticeship method. For one, the student is more-or-less at the
mercy of their supervisor. Moreover, top-rate researchers are certainly first-rate at doing but not always
in explaining (and unfortunately many in fact loathe teaching!?). Furthermore, this system perpetuates a
rich-become-richer model in academia: students who do not happen to attend the same institution as an
expert are often completely unable to learn a topic; and in choosing interns or students to hire, most
experts highly value previous research in their specific topic.

<h5>This post's goals</h5>
<p>My goal is to reproduce figures from Pelofske et al. 2022, which conveniently includes all their code on github here: https://github.com/lanl/Parallel-Quantum-Annealing.
